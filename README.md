# Turkish-NLP


The project is about generating words and sentences in Turkish based on certain calculations and rules. Turkish alphabet is assigned numerical values starting from 1. (e.g. letter_values = {'a':1, 'b':2, 'c':3, 'ç':4, 'd':5, 'e':6, ...} ) 


The project consists of 2 modules;
* Module-1 generates given number of words whose sum of letter values equal to a given number.
(e.g. sum of letter values for "yabancılar" or "şirket" is 100)

* Module-2 generates a sentence whose sum of letter values equal to a given number
